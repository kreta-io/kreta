Tests
-----

This library is completely tested by **[PHPSpec][1], SpecBDD framework for PHP**.

Because you want to contribute or simply because you want to throw the tests, you have to type the following command
in your terminal.

    $ bin/phpspec run -fpretty

>*Depends the location of the `bin` directory (sometimes in the root dir; sometimes in the `/vendor` dir) the way that
works every time is to use the absolute path of the binary `vendor/phpspec/phpspec/bin/phpspec`*
