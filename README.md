Prerequisites
-------------
To start to use this project, we recommend using a **Vagrant** virtual machine located in the root directory that provides a completely functional environment for running *Kreta*. This Vagrant that is imported as submodule is maintained by [benatespina](https://github.com/benatespina) in this [repository](https://github.com/benatespina/default-vagrant) so, we are pretty sure that you won`t any problems to use it; however, if you have any kind of question or doubt, do not hesitate to contact us.

To make it work, first of all you need to install [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html) on your system, which in turn requires [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

>  If you are on Windows, we recommend [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) to install Ruby and any ssh client as [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) for log into your Vagrant box.

This box has some dependencies so you must install [vagrant-hostsupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) plugin for Vagrant, which adds an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file on the host system and [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest) which automatically installs the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system.
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

Getting started
---------------

The recommended way to clone this project is using the following command in order to add *git submodules* too:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/kreta-io/kreta.git kreta

Then, inside `/vagrant` directory you have to copy the `parameters.yml.dist` in the same directory to `parameters.yml`, modifying the values with your favorite preferences. This is what we recommend:

```
virtual_machine:
    vhost:      kreta
    domain:     localhost
    vhostpath:  /var/www
    ip:         192.168.10.42
    port:       8080
    use_nfs:    true
    box:        precise64
    cpu:        1
    memory:     512

database:
    mysql:
        rootpassword: app
        user:         kretaUser     
        password:     123           
        name:         kreta

environments:
    ruby:
        sass: latest
        compass: 0.12.6
    symfony: true
```

In the next step, you have to build the *Vagrant* machine and then, you have to connect via **ssh** to the VM with the
following commands:

    $ cd /vagrant
    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh

> NOTE: sometimes when you type `vagrant up` of provisioned box, the `/dev/shm/symfony/cache` and `/dev/shm/symfony/logs`
folders are disappeared; to solve this problem you have to execute `sh scripts/clear_cache.sh`

Once, you are inside the *Vagrant* box you need to download Kreta's dependencies using **[Composer][6]**.

    $ composer install

After that, you have to load everything related to **database** (create database if it is not exist, create schema and load some fixtures). The fastest way is executing the following command.

    $ sh scripts/update_doctrine_dev.sh

Finally, you have to dump the assets files:

    $ gulp

And that's all! Now, if you access `http://kreta.localhost`, you will see your site up and running.

Tests
-----
This project is completely tested by full-stack **BDD methodology**.

For testing [PHPSpec][1] and [Behat][5] are used.

To run [PHPSpec][1] type the following

    $ bin/phpspec run -fpretty

To run [Behat][5] tests run the following

    $ sh scripts/pre_behat.sh
    $ bin/behat
